Transcript:

This module covers different persistence and transactional aspects that you can implement using the Apache Camel framework. It reviews key concepts about Camel development with JBoss Fuse and then extends those concepts to show how to use Camel subsystems on top of Red Hat JBoss WildFly. It shows how you can use the Arjuna transaction manager, which is part of the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) platform, instead of using Spring transaction managers.

The module also describes a NoSQL component and how to use Infinispan technology.
