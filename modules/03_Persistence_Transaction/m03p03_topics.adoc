== Module Topics

This module covers different Persistence and Transactional Aspects that we can implement using the Apache Camel Framework. We will cover key concepts already introduced within the Apache Camel foundational course
but it will be extended in order to see how to use the Camel Subsystems top of JBoss WildFly like also how we can use the Arjuna Tx Manager part of the JBoss EAP platform instead of Spring Tx Managers.
To be exhaustive, we will also play with a NoSQL component and use the Infinispan technology.
