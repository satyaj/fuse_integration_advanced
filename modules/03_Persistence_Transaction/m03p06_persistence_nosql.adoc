== Persistence NoSQL & Caching

The Apache Camel project supports NoSQL components like MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, EHCache (Hibernate caching), Couchbase but also newer projects like JBoss Infinispan, Apache Gora. One of the key benefit of some of the NoSQL components is that they can be used to cache information. High availability can be provided by replicating the cache using multiple JVMs. A cache of <key,value> pairs can be shared across multiple camel contexts.
