== Transactional Client

* Concept : Make the clientâ€™s session transactional so that the client can specify transaction boundaries
* Producer or Consumer can be Tx
* Not Equal to a Tx Route
* Not all Apache Camel endpoints support transactions
* Tx Client : File, JMS, ActiveMQ, JPA, ...

== Transactional Client

The Transactional Client pattern is supported by the Apache Camel Framework and it allows a client to specify the Transaction Boundaries. For a JMS client, that means that the JMS session will become transactional
instead of the Client or Auto Acknowledge and that the client will use behind the scene a Transaction Manager to commit/rollback the JMS session. The Transactional client behavior can be enable for an endpoint
which is a producer or consumer. When we setup this behavior for the endpoint, that does not mean at all that the Apache Camel Route will become transactional like we can do with the Transacted policy that we will present hereafter.
In order to use a Transactional Client, you must first identify which Tx Client you will use as some of them aren't Tx aware. The existing Tx Client are : File, JPA, JMS, ActiveMQ and next select the Transaction Manager that you will use. OF coourse, this choice will depend
where the project will be hosted, in JBoss EAP or JBoss Fuse. Arjuna Tx Manager will be the default choice for the EAP platform and Apache Aries Tx Manager the one used for the Fuse platform.
