=== Install the lab project

Download the latest release of the project published on the following GitHub repository: {course_git_repo} and install it locally. As this project contains the skeleton of the code
that you will use to resolve the use cases, we suggest that you next import it in a new Workspace of JBoss Developer Studio.

== Use case exercise

The different use cases should be developed as a collection of Java JUnit Test class within the corresponding Maven module part of the skeleton project.

[[usecase1]]
=== xxx

The goal of this use case is to design a Junit Test case using the class +org.jboss.fuse.security.camel.basic.BasicAuthRESTCamelDSLJettyHashLoginTest.java+ which extend the class +BaseJettyTest+ class.
