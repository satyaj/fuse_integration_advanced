== Business Activities Monitoring Metrics and Health Checks Lab

.Goals
* Configure your local environment to develop and explore use cases involving metrics and health checks
* Use MBeans with Jolokia
* Set up a health check to control consumers
* Collect history metrics

.Prerequisites
* Experience with Java, Spring, and Maven
* Experience with Camel development using Red Hat JBoss Fuse

.Use Cases
In this lab, you explore three use cases:

* <<usecase1>>
* <<usecase2>>
* <<usecase3>>

Each use case is developed as a collection of Java JUnit test classes in the corresponding Maven module of the skeleton project.

|===

=== Install Lab Project

. Download and install locally the latest release of the project published in the {course_git_repo} GitHub repository. 
. Because this project contains the skeleton code that you use to implement the use cases, import the project into a new JBoss Developer Studio workspace.


[[usecase1]]
== Use MBean with Jolokia

In this use case, you reuse the code developed in the last exercise of the _Business Activities Monitoring Notification Lab_.

. Use the Jolokia MBean server to register the MBean.
. Query the Jolokia MBean server using an HTTP request.
. Verify that the JSON response returned is correct.

[[usecase2]]
== Set Up Health Check to Control Consumers

. Develop a use case for a health check that ascertains whether the consumers are still alive:

* Use the `camel-metrics` component to perform this health check.
* You may find this code helpful in designing your implementation: link:https://github.com/commercehub-oss/dropwizard-camel/blob/master/dropwizard-camel-core/src/main/java/com/commercehub/dropwizard/camel/health/CamelHealthCheck.java[CamelHealthCheck.java^]


[[usecase3]]
== Collect History Metrics

. Query the history of the messages created by another Camel route.
. Collect the history and the metrics of the message processed within the processor.
