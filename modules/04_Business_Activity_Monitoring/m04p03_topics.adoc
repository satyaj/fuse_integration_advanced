Transcript:

In this module, you learn about monitoring business activity with Red Hat JBoss Fuse. The module covers different service techniques for monitoring and inspecting the message, body, and header information that is transported through Camel routes. The techniques range from less invasive to more invasive, depending on whether you use an EIP, interceptor, or a code extension via event notifications. The module also covers health checks and collecting history metrics. The module concludes with using the Nagios management platform to collect and send Camel route information.
