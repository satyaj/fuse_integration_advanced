== Extend JMX

* Goal: Register MBeans to collect information or expose operations
* Use Spring to register MBeans using `@ManagedResource`, `@ManagedOperation`, `@ManagedAttribute` annotations

* JMX example:
+
[source,java]
----
@ManagedResource(objectName = "mbeans:name=myJmxDemoBean", description = "My managed Bean.")
public class JmxDemo {
    // lot of stuff
}

@ManagedAttribute(description = "Get the number of all waiting applications" )
public long getNumberOfWaitingApplications() {
    return numberOfWaitingApplications;
}

@ManagedOperation(description = "Shows a list of all waiting applications with some information.")
public List<String> showWaitingApplications() {
    // do something and return a list of all waiting applications
}

Transcript:

Camel supports monitoring and controlling Camel objects with JMX. Camel registers many MBeans that expose statistics and operations for management. MBeans are divided into eleven categories. Most MBeans expose standard information and operations that relate to things such as life cycle. To monitor your application, use the JConsole UI to connect to local or remote hosts.
