Transcript:

To prepare for this module, Red Hat recommends that you review the information on the web pages shown here.

In addition, before investigating the strategies available for processing both large files and messages containing big strings and XML files, you should create some Camel routes using the file, FTP, or JMS components to collect large volumes of information to be processed. You should also review how to use the Apache Camel Splitter and Aggregator patterns.
