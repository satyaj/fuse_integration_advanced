= Improve performance of the Splitted items Lab

In this lab you resolve the following use cases:

<<usecase1>>

<<usecase2>>

<<usecase3>>

<<usecase4>>

.Goals
* Configure your local environment to develop and resolve use cases
* Become more experimented using Splitter EIP Pattern
* Process CSV records or XML data
* Use Reg expression, delimiter to split the stream of the data
* Extract XML content using an XML Expression language

.Prerequisites
* Experience with Java, Spring & Apache Maven
* Complete Red Hat OPEN course: Camel Development with Red Hat JBoss Fuse

=== Install the lab project

Download the latest release of the project published on the following GitHub repository: {course_git_repo} and install it locally. As this project contains the skeleton of the code
that you will use to resolve the use cases, we suggest that you next import it in a new Workspace of JBoss Developer Studio.

== Use case exercise

The different use cases should be developed as a collection of Java JUnit Test class within the corresponding Maven module part of the skeleton project.

[[usecase1]]
=== Stream CSV records


[[usecase2]]
=== Compare Stax vs DOM splitting


[[usecase3]]
=== Aggregate result to write a few times


[[usecase4]]
=== Use Async Component
