== Re-enforce Security

* Goal : Externalize/Delegate security endpoint to an Api
* How : Api acts as a Proxy/Gateway matching :
- Incoming request against 1toMany policies
- Deliver request to a target endpoint if validation succeeds
* Advantages:
- Tracking of APIs and consumers of those APIs
- Centralized governance policy configuration
