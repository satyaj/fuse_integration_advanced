=== Install the lab project

Clone the lab from the skeleton branch of the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/redhat-gpe/fuse_integration_advanced.git .

=== Configure Your Local Maven Environment

All the usecases to be designed involve using Apache Maven modules with dependencies on Apache Maven libraries supported in JBoss Fuse. Red Hat provides both online and offline Maven repositories for JBoss Fuse.
Follow these steps to configure these online repositories on your machine:

. Edit the Apache Maven `settings.xml` file located under the directory `$HOME/.m2` or `~/.m2`.
+
[NOTE]
If this file does not exist under this location, you can also edit the same file which is available under the `conf` subdirectory of the Apache Maven installation directory.
. Replace the contents of your Maven `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml` with this {settings}.
. Review the details of your new Fuse enabled `$HOME/.m2/settings.xml`
.. Within the `<profile>` tags in the `settings.xml` are defined the `JBoss Fuse` repositories that you need to build the code during execution of `mvn compile` or `mvn install` commands.
.. Within the `<activeProfile>` tags in the `settings.xml` is the name of the default profile used when Apache Maven is running.


=== Keys and certificates

Follow these instructions in order to create the Private/Public keys of the users to be used and their corresponding certificates

[source]
----
keytool -genkey -alias integration  -keyalg RSA  -keypass secUr1t8 -storepass secUr1t8 -keystore security/src/test/resources/integrationstore.jks
----

Add `localhost` as name for the first and last name field. You can define the value for the other fields as you want.
Here is an example `CN=localhost, OU=integration, O=enablement, L=fuse, ST=Unknown, C=US`

=== Resolve the use cases

The different use cases should be developed as a collection of Java JUnit Test class within the corresponding Maven module part of the skeleton project

[[usecase1]]
=== Generate SOAP Header with WSSE : username, timestamp & wrong password

The goal of this use case is to design a Junit Test case where the class +org.jboss.fuse.security.WSSecurityTest+ will include a @Test Junit method responsible to issue a SOAP Message where the SOAP Header generated by the WSS4J Interceptor of the client
will include a SOAP WSSE header section with a username and a timestamp to authenticate the JAXWS Client request.

This use case should issue a message containing a SOAP header with a user and a wrong password and the test must validate that the exception message reported during the fail process contains this message "Security processing failed."

The CXF web service must be created using the JaxWsServerFactoryBean class while the JAXWS client responsible to consume the echo service will be developed using the JaxWsProxyFactoryBean class.
No HTTP Transport must be used to configure the client but only the CXF Local transport. Both classes should be developed using the CXF interceptor pattern in order to generate the SOAP WSSE Section header
and process this section at the server site. The framework Apache WSS4J must be used and configured with the the CXF In/Out Interceptors.

No wsdl file will be used for this project but instead Java classes annotated with the JAX-WS @WebService annotation. The Echo interface and EchoImpl java class implementing the interface have been provided within the project.

For this use case, you will use as parameters to configure the WSS4J class the following properties :

- Actions : UsernameToken and Timestamp
- User : your user name as defined within the +org.jboss.fuse.security.service.PwdCallback+ class
- Password : a password which is incorrect
- Password Type : text

[NOTE]
====
* You can define the WSS4J parameters using the `setProperty` method of the class +AbstractWSS4JInterceptor+
* The JaxWsServerFactoryBean (server side) and JaxWsProxyFactoryBean (client side) must be configured to use the Crypto configuration files insecurity.properties and outsecurity.properties to sign/decrypt the messages using the parameters +signatureVerificationPropFile+ and +decryptionPropFile+. The properties files should be created within the resources directory +org/jboss/fuse/security/common+
* Both Crypto config files will use the same keystore file +integrationstore.jks+

[[usecase2]]
=== Generate SOAP Header with WSSE : username, timestamp & password

This usecase extends the previous but instead of sending a wrong password, you will send the correct password assigned to your username within the WSSE Section of the SOAP Header. Please use the `passwordCallbackClass` as WSS4J parameter
to let the Interceptor to get the password from the `PwdCallback` implementing the `CallbackHandler` interface. Within the handle method, loop within the list of the users till you find the user and assign the password
to the `WSPasswordCallback` object using the `setPassword` property.

Use the same Actions as defined for the Usecase 1 in order to generate a header containing the user credential and the timestamp.

[[usecase3]]
=== Generate a SOAP Message & sign its content

The goal of this use case is to sign the body of the message and its timestamp. The algorithms to be used to digest the signed content is +http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmlenc#sha256+ while the algorithm to be used to sign the content is +http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1+.
No UserName token Action is required for this use case but instead the Signature & TimeStamp actions.

Please use these parameters to configure the WSS4J class :

- Actions : Timestamp and Signature
- Parts to be signed : signatureParts
- Parts : body and timestamp
- Sign Algorithm : signatureAlgorithm
- Digest Sign Algorithm : signatureDigestAlgorithm

[WARNING]
====
* Take care to configure accordingly the Server and/or client classes and the In/Out interceptors
* Use the appropriate user to sign the message based on the key associated to its certificate
====

[[usecase4]]
=== Generate a SOAP Message & sign/encrypt the content

For this last use case, you will encrypt and sign the content of the message.

Please use these parameters to configure the WSS4J class :

- Actions : Encrypt and Signature
