== WS Security Policy - SOAP Message

* More granularity is offered if SOAP Message Protection is used
* Support Symmetric (Kerberos Token, ...) & AsymetricBinding (Pulic Key)
* Can sign and/or encrypt specific parts (Body, Headers, ...)

== WS Security Policy

By applying message protection at the SOAP encoding layer, instead of at the transport layer, you have access to a more flexible range of protection policies.
In particular, because the SOAP layer is aware of the message structure, you can apply protection at a finer level of granularityâ€”for example, by encrypting and signing only those headers that actually require protection.

The protection will be configured using a Security Binding which is either the AsymmetricBinding for public key cryptography or SymmetricBinding when private cryptography will used with Kerberos Token by example.

In asymmetric binding scenario, keys used for signature and encrypting should be clearly specified. An Asymmetric binding usually contains two main elements, InitiatorToken and RecipientToken.
These tokens provides room for specifying the tokens used in the signing/encrypting operations by the sender(initiator) and recipient respectively.
According to the specification, each of these two elements should contain tokens used for signing and encrypting. Most of the a X509 Token will be defined

In addition to those two elements, other properties like Algorithmic Suite, IncludeTimeStamp can also be specified in the Asymmetric Binding element similar to other security binding assertions
as explained within the previous slide

To Sign or Encrypt specific parts of the SOAP Message, the SignedPart or EncryptedPart XML tag will be sued and the childs elements included will define if the Body, a Header with its name or an attachment
should be signed or encrypted.
